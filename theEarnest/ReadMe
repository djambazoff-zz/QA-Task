Testing approaches and running instructions for JungleSocks
===========================================================

Testing approaches
I. Verification of each price item.
	For the matter of testing, we will accept that the expected price of an item
	will be the one displayed on the "Welcome" page.(Page1)
	Detailed comments for each step of the process of automation testing are 
	included in the script itself.( jungleSocks.java ) 
		The verification of each price item is done by individual price confirmation. 
		Here is the outline process:
		a) Navigate to "Welcome" page( https://jungle-socks.herokuapp.com/)
		a) Extract price item, and prepare for comparing.
		b) Input quantity - for the verifying price the quantity is equal to one, 
			for the rest of the items, the quantity is equal to zero.
		c)add ship-State, continue to "Checkout" page(page2)
		d)Extract actual price item from "Subtotal" field, prepare for comparing.
		e)Compare expected price from page1 to actual price from page2.
		f)Print a confirmation  report. 

II. Verification of each state's tax rate.
	Requirements: CA tax rate = 0.08, NY tax rate = 0.06, MN tax rate = 0.00,
				  all other state tax rates = 0.05
	For the matter of testing, we will not be paying attention on item's price and
	item's availability. Our focus is directed on whether the certain State's tax rate
	is correctly calculated.
	Detailed comments for each step of the process of automation testing are 
	included in the script itself.( jungleSocks.java ) 
		Here is the outline process:
		a) Navigate to "Welcome"(page1) page( https://jungle-socks.herokuapp.com/)
		b)Input desired quantity of items( in our case, one item per kind)
		c)Extract drop list with all states available from the drop-down field.
		d)Select the first available state ( for the matter of calculating the tax portion)
		e)Continue to checkout page ( page2)
		f) Extract the information from "Subtotal" and "Taxes" fields and calculate
		   the applied(actual) tax rate for the chosen state.
		g)Compare the actual  tax rate to the expected (as per requirements) tax rate.
		h)Print a confirmation  report.


Script running instructions:
===========================
	For the matter of successfully run script, we assume that we have already setUp
	testing environment and we know how to run test scripts as java application or as testNG.
	1. Create a new Java Project in Eclipse.
	2. Import "theEarnest" folder
	3. Run the testSuite:
		There are two java files in the package. Just for the case of assurance of test 
	running, the tests may be run from each individual java file. 
	For example, a) jungleSocks.java may be run directly as a java application.
		     b) testSuite.java may be run as TestNG. 
	

Happy Verification!
